      The schematic editor consists of an overhead component strip (the palette strip),
      an inspector panel, and a canvas for assembling components.

  <h4>The Palette Strip</h4>
  <p>
    The schematic palette strip is located at the top of the schematic editor and displays
    a row of schematic elements. It is a convenient component source so that you don't need
    to deal with the library window for frequently used components.
    Changes to the contents of the palette strip, however, can only be made in the
    library window.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add a copy of an element to the schematic you simply drag it from the palette to the canvas.

<div id="volta_help_schematic_palette_groups">
  <p>
    The palette in your library may contain many element groups but the schematic
    palette strip shows only one group at a time. Select the displayed group
    with the menu button at the top left.

<div id="volta_help_schematic_inspector">
  <h4>The Inspector</h4>
  <p>
    The inspector is a panel in the canvas for editing components.
    With the inspector you can rotate and flip components, change their model
    and their property values. If a single component is selected,
    you can also change the component name - as long as the name is not
    used by another component within the schematic.
    If multiple components are selected, you can only
    change the properties that are shared by all components.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name of the selected component is displayed at the top of the inspector.
    You can edit the name by clicking and typing. Below are the controls for positioning
    the label, for rotating, and for flipping (mirroring). Further below is the model
    chooser where you can select alternative, type-compatible models. Lastly, there
    is a table of properties and their values.
    You can start editing a property's value by double-clicking on the field next to the property name.
  </p>

<div id="volta_help_schematic_inspector_features">
  <p>
    For circuit components, the properties are SPICE properties. Refer to the
    <a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice24-manual.pdf">Ngspice manual</a>
    for their description.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inspector can be hidden and shown again by pressing the "Inspector"
    toolbar button.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inspector can be attached to any corner of the canvas.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="volta_help_schematic_connecting">
  <h4>Connecting Components</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      You connect two circuit components by dragging a connection line from
      the connection point (pin) of the first component to the pin of the
      second component. Each circuit component has at least one pin. Pins
      are highlighted in red when the mouse pointer is on top. A pin can
      accommodate only one connection. Use nodes, which have 4 pins,
      to join connectors.
      Disconnecting components is also easy: Simply drag the connector away
      from one of its connection points and let go.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="volta_help_schematic_connecting_screenshot_inline">
    <span class="figure">Figure 5: Connecting components</span>
    <img class="framed_screenshot" src="../images/common/schematic_creating_a_connection.png"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Initially, a connection is a straight line. By dragging points on the
      linear segments of the connector you can insert joints. To remove a
      joint you simply drag it back to the (imaginary) line between its
      neighboring joints (or connection points).
      Joints are highlighted in green when the mouse pointer is on top.
    </p>

    <h4>Zooming</h4>
    <p>
      The schematic can be scaled up to twice the standard size.
      This feature is intended to make working on small, high-resolution displays easier.
      You can change the zoom factor with the slider in the toolbar (figure 7) or with a pinching gesture on your trackpad.
