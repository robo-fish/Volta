  <h4>What is Volta?</h4>
  <p>
    Volta is a software application for designing analog electric circuits
    on Mac OS X. It offers graphical frontend and backend tools for
    SPICE-like command-line circuit simulators.

  <h4>Circuits</h4>
  <p>
    There is one window for each circuit design. You can work on
    multiple circuits at the same time, each in its own window.
    A circuit window contains four resizable areas as shown in figure 1.
  </p>
  <h4>Design Workflow</h4>
  <p>
    You typically start designing your circuit in the schematic
    editor where you assemble and interconnect circuit components.
    You then repeatedly test and refine your design with the help
    of circuit simulations.
    To run circuit simulations, you 'capture' the schematic
    in a format that the simulator can process.
    When the simulation is done, depending on the output of the
    simulator, the results will be displayed graphically in the
    plotter area at the bottom.

      <p>
        The first three buttons in the toolbar of the window ('Plot',
        'Capture' and 'Analyze') are your workflow buttons, where Plot and Analyze
        do more than their names imply. The Plot button also captures the schematic
        and runs the simulation. It is the button you will use most frequently.
        The Analyze button not only feeds the netlist and the analysis
        commands to the simulator but also plots the simulation results if
        sufficient data points exist. Use this button if you want to preserve
        changes that you made to the netlist after the schematic was captured.

  <h4>Ngspice</h4>
  <p>
    Volta ships with the free circuit simulator <a href="http://ngspice.sf.net">Ngspice</a>.
    One of the long-term goals of Volta is to wrap all Ngspice capabilities
    in easy-to-discover and, hopefully, easy-to-use graphical controls.
    Ideally, everything you can express with a netlist should be configurable in the
    schematic editor so that even for advanced use cases there is no need to
    edit netlists. Until this goal is reached you will need to know how to use
    Ngspice. Please refer to the detailed user manual on the
    <a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs.html">Ngspice documentation page</a>.
