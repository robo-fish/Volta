    The library window is the primary interface to your collection of
    device models, customized component groups, and subcircuits.
    You open the library window either through the main menu,
    Window &rarr; Library, or by selecting "Edit..." in the group
    selection menu of the schematic palette.

    <h4>Models</h4>
    <p>
      Similar to SPICE models, Volta models define classes of schematic elements.
      Unlike SPICE, Volta models also define classes of non-electrical schematic elements.
      A Volta model contains the common attributes of the class it defines:
      A shape, a set of connection points (i.e., pins), and a set of named properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      All available device models are listed in the "Models" section of
      the library. Models are grouped by type
      (resistor, diode, MOSFET, voltmeter, etc.). All models have a name, some
      also have a vendor ID. The vendor ID serves to further differentiate
      a model and is especially useful when distributing your customized models
      to other users. For example, you can use your name or your e-mail address
      as vendor ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Models can be dragged to a palette group or to a schematic, where
      components with default property values will be inserted.
    </p>
    <div id="volta_help_library_subcircuits_text_1">
      <h4>Subcircuits</h4>
      <p>
        The "Subcircuits" section of the library window lists all your subcircuits.
        A subcircuit item in the library window is a special kind of model that
        represents a Volta subcircuit document.
        A Volta subcircuit contains a SPICE subcircuit netlist, either captured
        from schematic or edited manually, that gets inserted
        when the schematic, in which the subcircuit is used, is captured.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="volta_help_library_subcircuits_text_2">
  <p>
    Unlike models and palette components, subcircuits are not editable within the
    library window. Double-click a subcircuit item or single-click its link button
    <img height="11px" src="../images/common/library_subcircuit_open.png">
      to open the corresponding subcircuit document. Make your
    changes and save the document. The library will detect the change and
    reload automatically without having to restart Volta.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subcircuits can be dragged to a palette group or to a schematic,
    where a component will be created.
  </p>
  <h4>Palette</h4>
  <p>
    The palette contains user-defined groups of circuit components
    (or other kind of schematic elements).
    Groups can be added <img style="vertical-align:-2px" height="16px" src="../images/common/library_palette_add.png">,
    renamed or removed <img style="vertical-align:-2px" height="16px" src="../images/common/library_palette_remove.png">.
    Likewise, components can be added to a group, renamed or removed.
    Group names must be unique and component names must be unique
    within their groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Palette groups can be populated by dragging models or subcircuits
    into the group. Dragging components from group to group is also
    possible and creates copies of the dragged components in the target folder.

  <h4>Library Storage</h4>
  <p>
    Except for the built-in models, the items in your library are loaded
    from and stored to user-accessible files. These files are located
    under Volta's library root folder, which is organized into sub-folders
    ("Models", "Palette", "Subcircuits") for the three types of library content.
    You can share your library content by distributing the files (please observe copyrights).
    Volta updates the library automatically when files are added to or removed
    from the above sub-folders.
  </p>
  <h5>Local vs. iCloud</h5>
  <p>
    The library root folder can be located either on your Mac or on iCloud.
    You can copy your locally stored library content to iCloud at any time and
    switch to using the iCloud library. The advantages of using the iCloud library
    are: having an online backup and automatic synchronization between multiple
    installations of Volta. The disadvantage is the risk of data loss when
    synchronizing two libraries which have been modified independently since the
    last synchronization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The local library will not be modified while you use the iCloud library.
    You can switch back to using the local library at any time. It is also
    possible to copy the library contents from iCloud to local (or from local
    to iCloud) without switching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Switching between the two libraries and copying the contents is done via
    the main menu, under "Volta" &rarr; "iCloud library".
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left">
    The library root folder for local storage is located at
    <code style="font-size:10pt;word-break:break-all">"~/Library/Containers/com.kulfx.Volta/Data/Library/Application Support/Volta"</code>,
    where <code>~</code> denotes your home folder.
  </p>
  <h5>Access from the Library Window</h5>
  <p>
    For each type of library content (model, palette, subcircuit) there is a button
    in the library window, which will reveal the contents of the corresponding
    library root sub-folder. When using your local library, the buttons look like a folder
    <img style="vertical-align:-2px" height="18px" src="../images/common/library_storage_folder.png">
    and the folder contents are presented in Finder. When using the iCloud library,
    the buttons look like a cloud
    <img style="vertical-align:-2px" height="18px" src="../images/common/library_storage_cloud.png">
    and the folder contents are presented in Volta's own file view window.
  </p>
  <h5>Storage of Custom Models</h5>
  <p>
    Custom models, that you create by copying (and modifying) existing models,
    will be stored in the model library file "CustomModels.volta".
    This is the only model library file whose
    contents can be modified from within Volta. Models read from
    other model library files can not be modified. That's why some models in
    the library can not be modified and show a lock symbol.
  </p>
  <h5>SPICE Model Library Files</h5>
  <p>
    In addition to library files in Volta's own file format, Volta can load
    models from SPICE library (<code>lib</code>) files. The following format is required
    for <code>lib</code> files:
    <pre style="font-size:10pt">.MODEL &lt;model name&gt; &lt;model type&gt;
+param1=value1 param2=value2
+param3=value3 param4=value4
...</pre>
    No space is allowed around the '=' sign.
    Comment lines starting with an asterisk (*) can be inserted everywhere.
  </p>
